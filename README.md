# ReverseBinaryTree
Visual Studio C++ 

This will not allow your trees to grow upwards, unless you really believe it can!

This little program makes a binary tree and reverses it. You could change the hardcoded test data and recompile - sorry this was done quickly!

There is another another function that you can substitute in (swap the comment // between lines 68 and 69).
They both do the same thing, reverse the binary tree. The difference is, one uses a recursive function.

I can't think of a good reason reason to do it recursively other than for fun. If you know why it might have a use, please get in touch!

To do:
1. Load an input data set - 'Deserialize' the Binary Tree
2. Save the output data set - serialise
3. Put it in test rig with validation data
4. Benchmark the Looping vs Recursive reverse
